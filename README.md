Acoustic-VINS: Tightly Coupled Acoustic-Visual-Inertial Navigation System for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles


In this work, we present an acoustic-visual-inertial
navigation system (Acoustic-VINS) for underwater robot localization. Specifically, we address the problem of the global
position of underwater visual-inertial navigation systems being
inappreciable by tightly coupling the long baseline (LBL) system
into an optimization-based visual-inertial SLAM. 

Additionally, for wider application, we extend the sensor data of the real-world AQUALOC dataset to obtain the LBL-AQUALOC dataset
